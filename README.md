# ATM-API

Problem Statement


We would like you to implement a web service containing REST API for an ATM. The use cases that you must fulfill are:
A customer can login to the ATM account by providing a 4 digit PIN number
A customer can view their current balance
A customer can deposit money
A customer can withdraw money

Instructions
We expect you to spend no more than 2 hours on this exercise, but we do value a complete solution. The requirements are left purposefully open-ended. Some aspects you may choose to focus on include:
Data persistence
Authentication
Concurrency
Fault-tolerance, etc.

Please consider that your solution should contain instructions on how to build, test, and execute your solution. UI is not necessary - simply being able to use any API client (e.g. Postman) to demonstrate your solution is adequate.

You may implement this in any language of your choosing: Java, Go, etc. Please submit the results as a link to public GitHub or Bitbucket repository.
